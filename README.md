# ece244 - All Labs from ECE244 Programming Fundamentals in C++
Welcome to the `ece244` repository! University of Toronto, Faculty of Applied Science &amp; Engineering, Fall 2024. Provides a foundation in programming using an object-oriented programming language. Topics include: classes and objects, inheritance, exception handling, basic data structures (linked lists, binary trees, and hash tables), big-O complexity analysis, testing, and debugging. The laboratory assignments emphasize the use of object-oriented programming constructs in the design and implementation of reasonably large programs.
