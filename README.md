# ece244 - All Labs from ECE244 Programming Fundamentals in C++
 - ECE244 course offered by University of Toronto's Faculty of Applied Science &amp; Engineering in **Fall 2024**
 - Provides a foundation in programming using an object-oriented programming language.
 - Topics include: classes and objects, inheritance, exception handling, basic data structures (linked lists, binary trees, and hash tables), big-O complexity analysis, testing, and debugging.
 - The laboratory assignments emphasize the use of object-oriented programming constructs in the design and implementation of reasonably large programs.
